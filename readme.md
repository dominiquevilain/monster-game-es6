# Monster Game - ES6

This is an adaptation of a game used by Maximilian Schwarzmuller in [his 
Udemy course about VueJS 2](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/).

The main purpose is to build an app with my students in order to lear some 
basic principles of Javascript programming.

This is an ES6 version, meant to be built using [laravel-mix](https://laravel-mix.com/), a wrapper 
around [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) from [Jeffrey Way]
(https://laracasts.com/series/learn-laravel-mix).
 
After cloning the repo, `npm install` or `yarn install`. Then `npm run hot` 
or `yarn hot`. Then, point your server to http://localhost:8080
